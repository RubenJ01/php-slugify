# Contributing

## Workflow

1. **Create an issue** on GitHub describing the feature or bug

2. **Start from main**

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   ```

3. **Create a branch**

   Use a descriptive prefix:
   - `feat/` for features
   - `fix/` for bug fixes
   - `ci/` for CI changes

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

4. **Make your changes**

   - Update or add tests
   - Update the README if the feature is user-facing
   - Run all checks locally with GrumPHP:
     ```bash
     php vendor/bin/grumphp run
     ```

5. **Commit with a conventional commit message**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add something new"
   ```

   Format: `type(optional scope): description`

   | Type   | When to use                          |
   |--------|--------------------------------------|
   | `feat` | A new feature                        |
   | `fix`  | A bug fix                            |
   | `ci`   | CI/pipeline changes                  |
   | `chore`| Maintenance, deps, tooling           |

   For breaking changes, add a `!` before the colon:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat!: change default behavior"
   ```

   Reference issues with `Closes #N` in the commit body.

6. **Keep it to one commit**

   If you have multiple commits, squash them:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i main
   ```

7. **Push and open a PR**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/my-feature
   ```

   Woodpecker CI will run phpcs, phpstan, and phpunit on the PR automatically.

8. **Merge with squash merge** on GitHub
